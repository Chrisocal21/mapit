# About MapFrame

## What Is MapFrame?

**MapFrame** (mapframe.app) is a specialized web application for capturing, processing, and optimizing map imagery for creative and practical applications. Whether you're creating custom wall art, preparing designs for laser engraving, or generating unique geographical prints, this tool provides professional-grade controls for transforming standard map views into production-ready images.

## Purpose

Traditional mapping services are designed for navigation, not creation. This application bridges that gap by offering:

- **Precise Area Selection**: Define exact capture regions with rotation support
- **Advanced Processing**: Convert map data into optimized outputs for specific use cases
- **Professional Editor**: Fine-tune contrast, threshold, and effects in real-time
- **Format Optimization**: Generate laser-engraveable files, high-contrast prints, or artistic variations

## Core Features

### Intelligent Selection System
- Drag-and-drop area definition with SPACEBAR manipulation
- Rotation support for non-standard orientations
- Dimension locking and precise measurement tools
- Multi-aspect ratio support (portrait, landscape, square)

### Processing Engine
- **Laser Mode**: Pure black-on-white conversion for engraving machines
- **Edge Detection**: Artistic boundary highlighting
- **Threshold Control**: Fine-tuned separation of light and dark areas
- **Text Enhancement**: Automatic label optimization with background boxes

### Professional Editor
- Real-time preview with 50-state undo/redo history
- Layer comparison (processed vs. original)
- Drag-and-drop interface customization
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users
- AI-powered optimization suggestions

### Export Options
- High-resolution PNG output (640px - 2560px)
- Direct clipboard copying
- Multiple style variations (standard, terrain, satellite)
- Format-specific optimizations (laser, print, digital)

## Common Use Cases

### Laser Engraving
Generate clean, engraveable designs for:
- Custom wooden maps
- Acrylic art pieces
- Metal engravings
- Personalized gifts (hometown maps, special locations)

### Wall Art & Prints
Create unique geographical artwork:
- Minimalist city maps
- Commemorative location prints (wedding venues, vacation spots)
- Custom neighborhood posters
- Large-format canvas prints

### Design & Creativity
Use as source material for:
- Graphic design projects
- Pattern generation
- Educational materials
- Location-based branding

## Technology

Built with modern web technologies for reliability and performance:
- **Leaflet.js**: Professional mapping engine
- **Canvas API**: High-performance image processing
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Client-Side Processing**: Your data never leaves your browser

## Philosophy

This tool is designed around three principles:

1. **Simplicity**: Complex capabilities wrapped in an intuitive interface
2. **Quality**: Professional-grade output suitable for production
3. **Control**: Every setting exposed, nothing hidden, full customization

## Privacy

All processing happens locally in your browser. No map data, coordinates, or images are transmitted to external servers (beyond the initial map tile requests from OpenStreetMap). Your selections, settings, and outputs remain entirely private.

## Development

This project is actively developed with regular improvements to:
- Processing algorithms (better edge detection, smarter text handling)
- User experience (faster workflows, more presets)
- Export formats (SVG support, Lightburn compatibility)
- AI capabilities (intelligent style recommendations)

## Roadmap

**Upcoming Features:**
- Workspace presets (save/load favorite settings)
- Batch processing (multiple locations in one session)
- SVG export for scalable output
- Lightburn file format support
- Advanced AI suggestions (style recommendations based on intended use)
- Template library (pre-configured settings for common use cases)

**Long-Term Vision:**
- 3D terrain generation
- Custom overlay support
- Collaborative sharing
- Professional marketplace integration

## Getting Started

1. Search for or navigate to your desired location
2. Define your capture area using SPACEBAR controls
3. Configure settings for your intended output format
4. Process and edit with real-time preview
5. Download your optimized image

## Target Audience

- **Makers**: Laser engraving enthusiasts, woodworkers, craftspeople
- **Artists**: Graphic designers, printmakers, fine artists
- **Gift Creators**: Custom present makers, Etsy sellers
- **Educators**: Teachers creating custom learning materials
- **Businesses**: Location-based branding, real estate marketing

## License & Usage

This application is designed for personal and commercial creative projects. Generated images are yours to use freely. Map data attribution follows OpenStreetMap guidelines.
